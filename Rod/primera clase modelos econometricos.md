# What is Econometrics?
Econometrics is based upon the development of statistical methods for estimating economic relationships, testing economic theories, and evaluating and implementing goverment and bussines policy.

### The structure of Economic Data
**Cross-Sectional Data (Tabular Data)**

- A **cross-sectional data set** consists of a sample of individuals, households, firms, or a variety of other units, taken at a given point in time but not precisely at the same time period. For example, several families may be surveyed during different weeks within a year.
- An important feature i ncross-sectional data is that we often assume that they have been obtained by **random sampling from underlying population**
- Sometimes, **random sampling is not appropiate as an assumption**, for example, when studying factors that influence the accumulation of family weath: wealthier families are less likely to diclose their wealth, then the resulting sample on weath is not a random sample from the population of all families.
- The ordering of the data does not matter for the econometric analysis.

### Causality and the Notion of Ceteris Paribus
In most of economic theory, and certainly for evaluating public policy, the economist's goual is to infer that one variable (such as education) has a **causal effect** on ther variable (such as productivity)

The notion of **ceteries paribus** -wich means "other (relevant) factors being equal"- plays an important role in causal analysis.
