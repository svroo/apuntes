## Mathematical optimisation in the real world 
- Optimising time in teh poduction cycle of an industry optimising tax in a tax return, optimising length in a tour are matheamtical optimisation problems we encounter in our daily life
- A solution that satisfying all the constraints is called a feasible solution
- The set of all solutions, satisfying all the constraints is called the feasible region

## New applications since 1990
- Linear matrix inequality techiques in control
- Circuit design via geometric programming
- Support vector machine learning vía quadratic programming
- Semidefinite programming relaxations in combinatorial optimisation
- L1-norm optimisation for sparse signal reconstruction
- Applications


- Linear Network optimization
	- Specialization of LP to problems with graph structure (shortest path, transpotation, trans-shipment,etc)
- Integer Programming
	- Decision variables are allowed only integer values
- Combinatorial optimisation
	- Decision variables have nice combinatorial structures (e.g. trees, permutations, matchings)



## special cases
- optimal solution need not be unique
- One of the special case is when variables


## Essential notions 
- Design variables
- Objective Functions
- Inequality constraint functions
- Equality constraint functions
- Optimum Vector

## What is mathematical optimisation
Formally mathematical optimisation is the process of formulation and solution a constrained optimisaion problem

- The values of the funtions $f(x), g(x)$, and $h(x)$ at any pint $x=[1.2]$ may in practice be obtained




## Problems types

- LImited or Unlimited
- One variable or Many variables
- Discrete Variable or continous variables
- Static Problems or Dynamic problems
- Deterministic or Stochastic Problems 
- Linear Equations or nonlinear equations

(los valores discretos son valores que están acotados)

# Sensitivity and robustness

- Evary model we write is only a coarse description of reality
- Conclusions about the model may more may not correspond to actual behaviour
- Validity of models often informal, implicit
- These considerations sometimes incorporated through sensity
- More recently, better techniques to explicit account of difference between real world and model (robust control, robust optimisation)

## Model classifications
- Unconstrained Optimisation
- Linear optimisation
- Linear constrained Optimisation
	- if the constraint functions are linear / affine
- Conic linear optimisation

# Mathematical optimisation

- Consider unconstrained optmisation
- Typically extremely difficult, many local minima
- Many questions can be posed in these terms (protein foldin)
	- very flexible formulation
	- but hard to do anything substantial with it
	- Complexity theoretic obstacles
- Objective funtion is convex
- Feasible set is convex
- Many advantages
	- Modeling flexibility
	- Tractability and scalability
	- Sensitivity Analysis relatively simple
	- Can naturally incorporate robust considerations
